In this project, we modeled the predicted number of accidents as a result of wet roads and lower visibility due to rain. We then combined this with a predictive representation of automobile costs in order to synthesize a model showing the estimated costs over time. With this model, we determined the feasibility of increasing public transportation as a means to decrease the costs of automobile damage and thus decrease auto insurance costs as a whole. This was done by running start-up static cost calculations and determining the average cost of maintenance per year for a 5-year period and cross-referencing the two models. Additionally, we used our models to determine whether the cost of insurance claims will increase, decrease, or remain stagnant in future years.
